What's new: Added mobile support (Android) with a responsive design that adjusts the transcript location to the screen orientation.

[Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/jw-org-video-transcript/) that uses the VTT subtitle file provided on the JW.org website to dynamically display a transcript window with a search functionality. 

* Clicking on each line in the transcript will jump to the corresponding video timestamp. 
* When video plays, current VTT line will be underlined in the transcript.
* Scroll button scrolls the transcript to show currently spoken line.
